Earlier today I was really ***, and I saw what I thought to be a blank DVD. I thought, DVDs have a ***, they might be pretty good. So I put a soft *** into the 
the DVD, and for a few seconds it seemed to be fine, but then, once ***, it started being painful. *** was stuck in the DVD, and I had to break it in half to get 
if out. It was then when I flipped the broken DVD over and realized that it was not a blank DVD, but a copy of the Pixar movie Up.. Well guys, guess I ***.
