How do I get my husband to stop going ‘Goblin Mode’ ***?

TLDR; My husband says ‘Goblin Mode activated’ when start to ***, growls and acts like a caveman, and then says ‘Goblin Mode off’ when we stop, and then pretends 
not to remember afterward.

I really love my husband and he’s always been great ***. But recently he’s been acting really weird. So, a couple of days ago, my son went on a rampage through 
our house and said he was in ‘Goblin Mode’. We didn’t really know what to do with him, so we sent him to live with my parents so he can go to a *** needs school. 
My husband a really great relationship with our son and loved him more than anything. Naturally, he was upset when he had to leave. He’s an incredibly tough 
man, 
but this was the first time I’ve ever seen him cry. I think since then, he’s been a little emotionally unwell. I’ve heard him muttering, ‘Goblin’ repeatedly 
when he didn’t notice me, staring blankly into his food, and just going alone by himself to do who knows what. I feel awful for him, but we both agreed that 
this was for the best. Last night, the day after our son went away, we decided to *** to relieve our stress. However, my husband said ‘Goblin Mode activated’, 
starting growling, and went wild *** me. Admittedly, it was some of the best and most *** I’ve ever had, but I’m worried that something might be going on with 
my husband. Any advice?
