So the other day, I was playing rainbow six siege, and I heard one of my teammates make a callout in the voice chat. It was a real life gamer girl. I kid 
you not, I just stopped playing and *** out. I was yelling in voice chat. I just wanted to hear her voice again. “Please”. But 
she left the lobby. I was crying and covered, but I remembered that I could find recent teammates in the ubiplay friends tab. I frantically closed 
down siege and opened the tab, to find out she had TTV IN HER NAME!!! She was streaming, and only had 100 viewers!!! The competition was low, so I made the first 
move and donated my months rent to her. I was already :0. She read my donation in the chat. This is the happiest I’ve been in a long time. I did a 
little research, but I am a little nervous to talk to her in person, and need support.
